# Face Meshing
Face Mesh is a face geometry solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time even on mobile devices. 
It employs machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D surface geometry, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a dedicated depth sensor. 
Utilizing lightweight model architectures together with GPU acceleration throughout the pipeline, the solution delivers real-time performance critical for live experiences.

Additionally, the solution is bundled with the Face Geometry module that bridges the gap between the face landmark estimation and useful real-time augmented reality (AR) applications. 
It establishes a metric 3D space and uses the face landmark screen positions to estimate face geometry within that space.
